H column is state of the keg

1. NEW
keg brewed, ready to be assigned to a customerID/whatever
2. SOLD
keg has been sold, row will no longer be used
same keg can be added into the database later as NEW
3. DEAD
keg is decomissioned or lost

#Keg states:
#I think keg states should be:
    0 - checked in, needs to be washed/filled
    1 - full of product, in taxable inventory from tabc perspective
    2 - checked out, assigned to an internal customer ID, meaning we have to pay taxes on this keg
    3 - decommissioned/end of life
    4 - lost/stolen (same as decommissioned but might be useful to track separately)

#Bottles:
#let's not deal with bottles now.  If we fill bottles off a keg as a one-off, we will just
#"sell" the keg to internal customer ID 1 (111 brewing) and pay the taxes.  We should normally
#fill bottles from the brite tank so the beer would never occupy a keg and we will deal with
#that scenario later on.  If you see a way we would shoot ourselves in the foot though please point
#that out.

possible states:
MT
keg is empty/sitting waiting to be washed/used (this state might not be nessecary)

USED
if you use the keg to fill other containers (bottles etc), mark the row status as USED
this way it won't be marked as SOLD
the smaller containers that are filled by that keg would have a status of FULL

FULL-X
for smaller containers that were filled from a keg
X is for the serial number of the keg that the beer came from (could be used for QC)

Maybe could use a different spreadsheet for bottles/growlers, and keep the kegs in their own spreadsheet
