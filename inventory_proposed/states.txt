H column is state of the keg

1. NEW
keg brewed, ready to be assigned to a customerID/whatever
2. SOLD
keg has been sold, row will no longer be used
same keg can be added into the database later as NEW
3. DEAD
keg is decomissioned or lost


possible states:
MT
keg is empty/sitting waiting to be washed/used (this state might not be nessecary)

USED
if you use the keg to fill other containers (bottles etc), mark the row status as USED
this way it won't be marked as SOLD
the smaller containers that are filled by that keg would have a status of FULL

FULL-X
for smaller containers that were filled from a keg
X is for the serial number of the keg that the beer came from (could be used for QC)

Maybe could use a different spreadsheet for bottles/growlers, and keep the kegs in their own spreadsheet
this way the serial number from the keg could be stored in a seperate column, also would be easier to migrate to sql later on
