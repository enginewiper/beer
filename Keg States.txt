H column is state of the keg

#Keg states:
#I think keg states should be:
    0 - checked in, needs to be washed/filled
    1 - full of product, in taxable inventory from tabc perspective
    2 - checked out, assigned to an internal customer ID, meaning we have to pay taxes on this keg
    3 - decommissioned/end of life
    4 - lost/stolen (same as decommissioned but might be useful to track separately)

#Bottles:
#let's not deal with bottles now.  If we fill bottles off a keg as a one-off, we will just
#"sell" the keg to internal customer ID 1 (111 brewing) and pay the taxes.  We should normally
#fill bottles from the brite tank so the beer would never occupy a keg and we will deal with
#that scenario later on.  If you see a way we would shoot ourselves in the foot though please point
#that out.
